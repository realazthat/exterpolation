# Exterpolation


I hereby define the term **_Exterpolation_**.

_Exterpolation_: The generalization of "[interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation)" and "[extrapolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation)". This word unifies both meanings - which share identical equations, but over different domains - to also share identical domains. Both linear interpolation and extrapolation can use the "[lerp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation#Programming_language_support)" algorithm, but when $0 \le t \le 1$ it is called "interpolation" and otherwise "extrapolation". _Exterpolation_ lets you refer to both at once, for any $t$.
